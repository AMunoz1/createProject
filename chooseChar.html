                        You are a young child living in  a poor territory of late 19th-Century England.
                        Your parents died soon after the birth of your sister, during a barbarian raid.
                        You ran away from the cruel caretakers at the orphanage, and now live on the
                        streets, pickpocketing and scavenging for basic necessities. One day you hear news
                        of a traveling trader coming through the town. The town doesn't get visitors like this often,
                        so it is likely there will be a large crowd of curious onlookers.
                        You are confident that you will be able
                        to steal amidst the crowd, so you make your way over with your sister.
